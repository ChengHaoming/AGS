1. Please install our modified [caffe](https://github.com/maysina/PDB-ConvLSTM/blob/master/maycaffe-convlstm.rar) first. 

2. Download the model weight from https://drive.google.com/open?id=1aO2nAaQMy-A76NjRSQDTx53AfpqyWUCt and put dvap_agos.caffemodel into the 'model' folder.
 
3. Then edit paths in './test/test.py' and './test/davis_bs3.txt'.

4. After you get the original results from the network, you can use './test/davis_crf.py' to process them.

5. Our results on DAVIS16, FBMS and Youtube can be find at 'seg_results.rar'.

6. Human eye fixation data for DAVIS16, Youtube and Segtrackv2 can be found at https://drive.google.com/open?id=11LAg69lnCp7TfWFYjntPm4RK4KfgL8_Y.

7. Our model and fixation data can also be found at Baidu Pan
